I interested in django so i practice everyday.

Here, I have created a pizza project, where the pizza project has one app, which is called PizzaApp. 
Pizza project contains 7 pages. one for the admin login page & 2'nd for the admin dashboard page where admin can add pizza.
3rd page for the admin order page, where dmin can see all clients's ordered pizzas; he can accept or decline orders.
4th page for user(client) signup page where can create an his account & 5th page for client login page.
On the 6th page, the client can choose the pizza and quantity and place an order.
7th page, The client gets update from the client's dashboard where he ordered the pizza.
